## Why Boxing Undefeated

People always say "you don't play boxing".

Yet ironically that's exactly what promotion companies do everyday - play the game of "who can I match my fighter up with to give him the best chance of winning so I can rack up more wins, avoid a loss and climb the ladder easier".

It's a pure game - but they HAVE to play it the way boxing currently is.

It's a shame.

It hurts the industry.

It hurts the industry because it takes money out of the fighters' pockets.

It takes fights away from the fans.

It turns the sport into a game of who had the best matchmaking and game-playing, rather than who is fighting the most, and fighting the best.

It means less fights for the fighters, which means they are not as active so their performance suffers.

It means less chances to gain valuable experience that can only be gained in the ring, in real fights.

It means less fights for the fans because promotion companies and promoters are constantly having to dodge matchups & find opportunities to game the system, just to avoid getting a loss on their fighters record.

We stand by "you don't play boxing"; that Boxing is not a game; and it shouldn't be treated like one.

Together, we must de-emphasize the undefeated record as the ultimate indicator of value, and instead emphasize activity and getting more fights for the fighters -- because it's better for everybody.

It's better for the fighters & their team.

It's better for the fans.

It's better for the sport of boxing.

"EVERYBODY's 'O' has got to go!"

Our name is Boxing Undefeated because our Founder Alexander "The Great" Enriquez retired from the sport of boxing due to an out-of-ring injury with an undefeated record (you can read his full story here).

It doesn't mean that we only celebrate boxers with undefeated records, or think that being undefeated means anything of consequence - in fact, the complete opposite.

Being undefeated means you haven't faced defeat in the ring (officially).

We all know that many fights are robberies.

We also know that you can rack up an undefeated record beating bums.

Having a loss on your record does not mean you are defeated. It means you faced defeat.

Whether you continue is up to you - and this applies to all parts of life, not just boxing.

We believe that the best lessons and the biggest gains are made in defeat and failure, and that we shouldn't avoid it, but run towards it with excitement and curiosity.
