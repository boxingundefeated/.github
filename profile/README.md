# Boxing Undefeated

Boxing Undefeated is a website and fitness organization dedicated to all things boxing. We help people learn and train in boxing to get fit, gain confidence, improve their athleticism, or even go professional.

Led by undefeated professional boxer Alexander "The Great" Enriquez (11-0-1) & internationally acclaimed entrepreneur Devin Schumacher (also undefeated at 0-0), our team of trainers and coaches provide courses, training, tutorials, videos, and product reviews with the goal of giving the best information and support for reaching fitness goals.

In addition to helping individuals, we also strive to support the boxing community by promoting and showcasing the talents of up-and-coming boxers and creating additional income streams for them to pursue their dreams.

Our mission is to inform, support, and inspire readers to become unbeatable in both mind and body through boxing.
